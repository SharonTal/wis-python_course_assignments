This program analyzes sequences from Fasta or GeneBank files. It supports two analyses:
1. Finding the longest duplicated subsequence.
2. Finding the most common k-mer (substring of specified length).



## Usage

Run the program with one or both analysis options:


python day9.py FILE --duplicate
python day9.py FILE --kmer 3
python day9.py FILE --duplicate --kmer 5


### Options:
- `FILE`: Path to the Fasta or GeneBank file.
- `--duplicate`: Find the longest duplicated subsequence.
- `--kmer`: Find the most common k-mer of the specified length.
